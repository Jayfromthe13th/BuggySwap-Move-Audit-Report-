### Introduction

Welcome to BuggySwap, an intentionally vulnerable coin-swapping protocol designed for the Hyacinth platform. This repository aims to help developers identify and understand common vulnerabilities in Move protocols on the Aptos blockchain.

### About BuggySwap

BuggySwap is an Automated Market Maker (AMM) that utilizes an oracle for pricing. Liquidity Provider (LP) coins minted within BuggySwap represent the USD value of liquidity deposits and withdrawals. The platform also supports limit swap orders.

#### Features:

- **Automated Market Maker (AMM):** Provides liquidity for trading pairs.
- **Oracle-based Pricing:** Uses an oracle to fetch and provide accurate pricing information.
- **LP Coins:** Represent the USD value of liquidity deposits and withdrawals.
- **Limit Swap Orders:** Allows users to set specific conditions for their swap transactions.

### Purpose

The primary purpose of this repository is to showcase and demonstrate common vulnerabilities that are often found in Aptos Move protocols. By studying BuggySwap, developers can learn to identify and mitigate these vulnerabilities in their own projects.

### Important Notice

This contract is deliberately designed to contain vulnerabilities. It is intended solely for learning and educational purposes within the Hyacinth platform. Under no circumstances should it be used in a production environment.
